# üîê Laravel Middleware - Complete Developer Guide



# Middleware in Laravel

## Definition
Middleware are HTTP filters that handle requests before they reach the controller or after they are processed. They act as a bridge between a request and a response, allowing you to filter and modify HTTP requests entering your application.

## Creating Middleware

Use the Artisan command to generate a new middleware class:

```bash
php artisan make:middleware CheckAge
```

This command creates a new middleware file in the `app/Http/Middleware` directory.

## Middleware Example

Here's a basic example of a middleware that checks if a user is over 18:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class CheckAge
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        if ($request->age <= 18) {
            return redirect('home');
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

The middleware receives the request and a closure (`$next`) that represents the next middleware in the pipeline. If the age condition is not met, it redirects to the home page; otherwise, it passes the request to the next middleware.

## Registering Middleware

To use your middleware, you need to register it in the `app/Http/Kernel.php` file:

```php
// In app/Http/Kernel.php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'check.age' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckAge::class,
];
```

This registers the middleware with a key (`check.age`) that you can use to reference it in routes and controllers.

## Using Middleware

### In Routes

Apply middleware directly to routes:

```php
// In routes file
Route::get('/admin', function () {
    return 'Admin Panel';
})->middleware('check.age');
```

### In Controllers

Apply middleware in controller constructors:

```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('auth');
        $this->middleware('check.age')->only('show');
    }
}
```

You can use `only()` to apply middleware to specific methods or `except()` to exclude certain methods.

## Global Middleware

Global middleware runs on every HTTP request to your application. Register it in the `$middleware` array:

```php
// In app/Http/Kernel.php
protected $middleware = [
    \App\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies::class,
    \App\Http\Middleware\CheckForMaintenanceMode::class,
];
```

## Middleware Types

- **Global Middleware**: Runs on all requests
- **Route Middleware**: Runs on specific routes or route groups
- **Controller Middleware**: Applied within controller constructors

## Common Use Cases

- Authentication and authorization
- CORS handling
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- Logging
- Security checks


## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Custom Middleware

Use Artisan to generate a new middleware class:


php artisan make:middleware EnsureTokenIsValid
