# 🚦 Laravel Routing Example

Welcome to the **Routing** example branch of this Laravel Basics project!

## 📚 What is Routing?

Routing is a fundamental part of Laravel. It allows you to define the URLs (endpoints) your application responds to and what code should execute when those URLs are accessed.

## 💻 Example Code

Here’s a simple route defined in `routes/web.php`:

```php
Route::get('/hello', function () {
    return ' Hello My name is Halima and this is Laravel Routing!';
});

## 🖼️ Output Screenshot
